An unofficial Notion API tool set for Svelte & Sapper

This package uses https://github.com/splitbee/notion-api-worker to generate the API. You can host this yourself, but OOTB it uses https://notion-api.splitbee.io/

This package is very experimental and subject to change. Check out a working page here: https://www.scotttolinski.com/notion

## How To Use

`npm install @leveluptuts/svelte-notion`

### Svelte

```

<script context="module">
    import { Notion, fetchNotion } from "@leveluptuts/svelte-notion";

    const fetchImage = (async () => {
        const pageId = `3e03212e646e41caaa560408162dee99`
        return await fetchNotion({ id: pageId, context: this })
    })()
</script>

{#await fetchImage}
    <p>...waiting</p>
{:then blocks}
    <Notion {blocks} />
{:catch error}
    <p>An error occurred!</p>
{/await}


```

### Sapper

```

<script context="module">
  import { Notion, fetchNotion } from "@leveluptuts/svelte-notion";

  export async function preload() {
    const pageId = `3e03212e646e41caaa560408162dee99`;
    const blocks = await fetchNotion({ id: pageId, context: this });
    return { blocks };
  }
</script>

<script>
  export let blocks;
</script>

<Notion {blocks} />

```

## What's supported currently

(shout-out to splitbee for this dope table. I borrowed from his React Notion repo)

We happily accept pull requests to add support for the missing blocks. I'll be adding as many as I can asap.

## How To Host Your Own API

## FAQ

### Is this practical?

Maybe? I could be much more very soon.

### I thought Notion didn't have an API?

It don't. Don't hold your breath on this working forever. See the Splitbee package for more info. The intention would be to migrate this to the official API once it's released.
